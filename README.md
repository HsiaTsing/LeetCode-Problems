## LeetCode-Problems

------

If everything goes well, I will finish my doctorate before next June. Preparing for coding tests in some job interviews, I should come back to knowledges of algorithm and data structure. Therefore, I create this repo to record the process when I'm trying to solve the problems on leetcode.com. Some codes in this repo are written all by myself and some are finished after referring solutions from others.
